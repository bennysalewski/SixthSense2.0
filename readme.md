## Description

This repository contains the sourcecode of Sixth Sense 2.0. The Sixth Sense 2.0 is a glove, which shows you where north is by vibration, if it is held vertically. If it is held horizontally, it shows you where north is with a led ring on the back of the hand.
Besides this it also shows you, if an anticyclone or a cyclone is coming by changing the color of the led ring. If there is no data yet, the color will be white. If an anticyclone is coming, the color will change to orange. If a cyclone is coming, the color will change to blue.
